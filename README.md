# Greenhouse Monitoring and Control System

This project simulates a **Greenhouse Monitoring and Control System** that uses the **OSGi framework** to manage and control various devices and services. The system is designed to monitor and control the environment within a greenhouse, managing factors like temperature, humidity, soil moisture, and UV light levels.

## Features

### Main Menu
1. **Get Sensor Data**: Displays sensor data and adjusts devices based on threshold values.
2. **Customize Sensor Data**: Allows the user to modify the threshold values for temperature, humidity, soil moisture, and UV light.
3. **Control Temperature Devices**: Manage temperature control devices such as heaters and air conditioners.
4. **Control Humidity Devices**: Manage devices like humidifiers to maintain desired humidity levels.
5. **Control Soil Moisture Devices**: Control irrigation devices based on soil moisture levels.
6. **Control UV Light Devices**: Manage UV light systems to maintain optimal light conditions for plants.
7. **Exit**: Exit the system.

### Device Management Menus

For each device type (Temperature, Humidity, Soil Moisture, UV Light), users can:

1. **Add Device**: Add a new device to the system.
2. **Remove Device**: Remove an existing device from the system.
3. **Change Device Mode**: Toggle the device mode between ON/OFF and adjust based on sensor data.
4. **View All Devices Info**: List all available devices and their current status.
5. **Disable Devices**: Disable specific devices or all devices at once.

### Detailed Device Control Logic

- **Temperature**: The system controls heating or cooling devices based on the temperature threshold. If the temperature exceeds the threshold, cooling devices (like air conditioners) are activated. If itâ€™s below the threshold, heating devices (like heaters) are activated.
- **Humidity**: The system monitors the humidity level and activates a humidifier when the level drops below the threshold.
- **Soil Moisture**: The system manages irrigation devices, turning them on when soil moisture is below the threshold.
- **UV Light**: The system ensures UV light devices are activated when the light level is below the desired threshold.

### System Architecture

The system uses the **OSGi framework**, which allows for dynamic module management and communication between various components:

- **GreenHouseController**: The main controller that interacts with the devices and presents menus for the user.
- **Service Consumers (HumidityServiceConsumer, SoilMoistureServiceConsumer, TemperatureConsumer, UVLightServiceConsumer)**: These classes consume data from the respective service producers.
- **Service Producers (HumidityServiceProducer, SoilMoistureServiceProducer, TemperatureSensorProducer, UVLightServiceProducer)**: These classes provide the data and manage thresholds for the devices.
